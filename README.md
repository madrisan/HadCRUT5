# Visualize the HadCRUT5 temperature datasets

> HadCRUT5 is a gridded dataset of global historical surface temperature anomalies relative to a 1961-1990 reference period.
> Data are available for each month from January 1850 to December 2018 (updates will be available in time), on a 5 degree grid.
> The dataset is a collaborative product of the Met Office Hadley Centre and the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia.

## Plot of the temperature anomalies

The following plots have been generated by the Python script `hadcrut5-plot.py`.
It requires the Python libraries: Matplotlib, netCDF4, NumPy, and Requests.

### Related to 1961-1990

> Stations on land are at different elevations, and different countries calculate average monthly temperatures using different methods and formulae.
> To avoid biases that could result from these differences, monthly average temperatures are reduced to anomalies from the period with best coverage (1961-90).
> For stations to be used, an estimate of the base period average must be calculated.
> Because many stations do not have complete records for the 1961-90 period several methods have been developed to estimate 1961-90 averages from neighbouring records or using other sources of data (see Osborn and Jones, 2014; Jones et al., 2012).
>
> Over the oceans, where observations are generally made from mobile platforms, it is impossible to assemble long series of actual temperatures for fixed points.
> However it is possible to interpolate historical data to create spatially complete reference climatologies (averages for 1961-90) so that individual observations can be compared with a local normal for the given day of the year (more discussion in Kennedy et al., 2011).

### Related to 1850-1900

> Previously, the period 1850-1900 has been used as the historical baseline, but this period includes some large volcanic eruptions and is after greenhouse gas concentrations had already started to rise.
> We suggest that the earlier period of 1720-1800 is a better choice for this baseline.
> This is because the major natural factors that also affect Earth’s climate – the levels of solar and volcanic activity – were both at similar levels to today.

### Related to 1880-1920

Global temperature in the 1880-1920 base period is
[for someones](https://mailchi.mp/9fc4a88a5c69/global-temperature-in-2020?e=a838466c17)
a reasonable estimate of *pre-industrial* temperatures.
